# PSOCUnityEditorTools

This repository contains tools and scripts for the PSOC System for Unity Editor, designed to enhance the development experience by automating scriptable object creation and management. This can be a valuable resource for developers looking to streamline their workflow, or release this as a service for eventual modding support.

# What is PSOC?

PSOC stands for "Phils Scriptable Object Composer" and it is a set of tools that allows you to automate tasks using LLMs (Large Language Models) that would usually be done by experienced hands in Unity. Specifically, this tool allows you to automate workflows that create game content by creating and composing scriptable objects in Unity. When creating this content, the LLMs can use your game design documents and guidelines to generate content that fits your game.

This is not a coding helper, but a content creation helper. It is designed to help you create game content like creatures, items, and other game objects by using the power of LLMs to generate and compose scriptable objects in Unity.

# Setup 

PSOC requires access to a local hosted or online backend that handles the LLM requests, this package is only for you to link existing resources to the psoc system.
